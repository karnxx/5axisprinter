### Day 1: 2025-05-24 (2 hours):
-Started with the printer. i am trying to make something similar to multipoledynamics' "Archer Demonstrator". [Here](https://youtu.be/B9sdrezl6AU?si=WmDl--JQkKZQOYiN) is a working of multipoledynamics' printer. Finished frame (500x500). i will try to make a 5 axis 3d printer with 4 filament.

- Did some research on editing gcode and using mmu, https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/1857m0h/guide_poor_mans_multi_material_what_to_edit_in/
- As there are no multiple color thing in 5 axis slicers (new tech), we will have to edit the gcode ourselves. this can be done by using coding languages, like python or smtn.


### Day 4: 2025-05-27 (4 hour):
- finished the toolhead. using E3D's revo.
- done with most of the xy stuff, the brackets remain.
- toolhead looks drippedd outtt
